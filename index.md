## Investigation of epitaxial deposition of metastable phases of Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> for opto-electronic applications
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor historically used as TCO; now re-emerged as oxide semiconductor of choice for application in niche areas of deep UV optoelectronics and power electronics. Owing to its ultra wide band gap can operate in regime of UV B, which makes it intrinsically solar blind and therefore is less noise prone with excellent UV to visible rejection ratio, low noise equivallent power, high light to dark current ratio. </p>


### Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> polymorphs
Ga sesquioxide exhibit five polymorphs &alpha;-, &beta;-, &gamma;-, &kappa;-/&epsilon;- and &delta;-. Most stable phase is &beta;-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> possesing highly assymetric monoclinic crystal structure.
